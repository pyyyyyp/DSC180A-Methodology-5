## Brainstorming for Quarter 2 Project Proposal

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic has been the partitioning algorithm for chip design.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I would like to investigate a graph machine learning model to predict and identify congestion hotspots in IC layouts early in the design process.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A potential change could be to read more relevant papers about graph machine learning models and congestion prediction.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I am interested in exploring techniques such as feature engineering for local density, routing complexity, and proximity to critical components.
